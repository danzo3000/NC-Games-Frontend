This app was created as part of a solo project on the Northcoders training bootcamp using React. I also built the backend as part of this project (see: LINK HERE) using data supplied by the NC team. 

The project demonstrates the following functionality:

-Users can view a list of all board game reviews on the homepage, and are able to filter these according to category if they wish.
-Users can sort the reviews by title, date, or number of votes, in ascending or descending order.
-Users can navigate using the navbar pinned to the top of the screen.
-Users are able to upvote reviews they like, but only once, a second click undoes the upvote.
-Users are able to view any comments on a single review.
-Users are able to login (using a pre-made set of user accounts) and leave comments as that user.
-Users recieve optimistically rendered feedback on their actions, with appropriate error/loading messages.
